# DarkWebSite1

This is, quite simply, my (successful) attempt at making a site and hosting it on the dark web, temporarily, at the following address: 

`http://6wntj6jy6zuvqa4w5oyippqknp2u6cuvksaekqdfqtkroc4k7gdu4cqd.onion/`

The below screenshot is what it looked like in the Tor browser accessed via Kali Linux VM on my laptop as of April 13, 2023 at 10:56 AM CST.
